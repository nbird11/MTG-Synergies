      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Many players of the card game Magic the Gathering understand that there are many ways to play the game, from what format they might play to whether it be casually with friends or at the tournament level. For the purposes of this site, we will be focusing on the Commander format of the game, and we will be taking a look at some different metas and interesting synergies (card combonations that work well together) within that format.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <!--This was my previous idea, but I have decided that I'm going to change it to something a bit easier to get content for during the course of this class.-->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The people who I imagine will be interested in this site are most likely going to be the types of people who play or are at least interested in the playing card game Magic the Gathering. That might include people in the age range from high school to their late twenties or early thirties, although Magic can be enjoyed by people of all ages! This site is for those people who are looking for new ways to play certain cards together or who are trying to learn some interesting combos!</p>  <!-- change this -->
